    <h1>DIFFERENT HAZARDS</h1>
    <p>
        Disasters are serious disruptions to the functioning of a community that exceed its capacity to cope using its own resources. <br>
        Disasters can be caused by natural, man-made and technological hazards, as well as various factors that influence the exposure and vulnerability of a community.

            <h3>World Disaster Report- Covid 2022</h3>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has been the biggest disaster in living memory, on almost any measure. More than 6.5 million people are confirmed to have died in less than three years, and the pandemic’s indirect impacts have touched the lives o<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">f virtually every community on the planet.
                Our World Disasters Report 2022 focuses on the coronavirus pandemic and preparedness: both the ways preparedness ahead of COVID-19 was inadequate, and how the world can prepare more effectively for future public health emergencies. 
                For the IFRC, preparedness encompasses preventing, responding to, and recovering from an emergency. Being truly prepared therefore means being ready to respond, to recover, and to learn lessons for next time. In other words, preparedness is an ongoing, continuous process. 
                We can save lives simply by being prepared. The next pandemic could be just around the corner: if the experience of COVID-19 won’t quicken our steps toward preparedness, what will?</span>
